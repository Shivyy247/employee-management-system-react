# Employee Management System 🚀

A modern, interactive, and responsive Task Management System built using **React.js** and **Tailwind CSS**. This project features a sleek "Dark Mode" aesthetic with glassmorphism effects and smooth animations using **Framer Motion**.

## 🎨 UI/UX Features
- **Glassmorphism Design:** Translucent backgrounds with frosted-glass effects.
- **Interactive Animations:** Micro-interactions on buttons and smooth entrance animations for cards.
- **Responsive Layout:** Fully optimized for desktops and tablets.
- **Dynamic Headers:** Personalized greetings for logged-in users.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **State Management:** React Context API (AuthContext)
- **Persistence:** LocalStorage API
- **Animations:** Framer Motion & Lucide Icons

## 🔐 Demo Credentials
Since this project uses `localStorage` for data persistence, use the following accounts to test the different dashboards:

### Admin Portal
- **Email:** `admin@example.com`
- **Password:** `123`

### Employee Portal
- **Email:** `emp1@example.com`
- **Password:** `123`
*(Other employees: `emp2@example.com`, `emp3@example.com`, etc., all with password `123`)*

## 🚀 How it Works
1. **Authentication:** The app checks the `localStorage` for existing user data upon launch.
2. **Admin Dashboard:** Admins can create tasks, assign them to specific employees, and see a real-time summary of all task statuses (New, Active, Completed, Failed).
3. **Employee Dashboard:** Employees view their specific tasks in a horizontally scrollable list and can update their status.
4. **Data Persistence:** All task updates and creations are saved to the browser's `localStorage`, ensuring data remains even after a page refresh.
